# CAP-Learning-Process
## What is SAP CAP?
The Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade cloud applications. It guides developers along a golden path of proven best practices, which are served out of the box by generic providers cloud-natively, thereby relieving application developers from tedious recurring tasks.

In effect, CAP-based projects benefit from a primary focus on domain, with close collaboration of developers and domain experts, rapid development at minimized costs, as well as avoiding technical debts by eliminating exposure to, and lock-ins to volatile low-level technologies.

## Why is SAP CAP important?
The name (Cloud Application Programming) already indicates its focus on cloud. However, a CAP application can handle reading and writing data to an on-premises system such as S/4HANA just fine. CAP is ideal for combining data from different sources. A good use case for using CAP is keeping your S/4HANA system clean. By running the custom application and custom data in the cloud, but where data from the (on-premise) S/4HANA system can be worked with at the same time, the developer builds an application that fits your needs perfectly, does not pollute the (on-premise) S/4 system with custom data.

In addition, for the user interface, you are free to choose which technology to use. Does your organization use SAP Fiori/SAPUI5 apps? Then CAP fits this perfectly. If your organization works with another user interface such as Angular or React, this is also no problem and works well as a UI for a CAP application.
